# Python_AutosTask_Mailstore_Integration
Python script that send invoices through autotaks, based on mailstore data.

The aim of this repository is to briefly explain one of my past projects, the script is still in use today, I am perfectly aware that the code that I wrote isn't optimized at all and many things should be changed for different reasons. This was my first project regarding APIs and it's been a long journey since then. The time for the project was also very short (4 days) with no appropriate time for testing and I was working alone on this project.
Autotask documentation wasn't clear at all and hard to setup, I hope that this repo could help someone figure that out.

I can't give out the code since it's under the company's copyright (you're not missing out on anything special) but i will provide the documentation at the following link: https://melodious-rice-a6a.notion.site/Sviluppo-Python-d0eb614670e64419811435498cb94831?pvs=4
